Advanced Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Intelligent Enemies - We selected this because enemies are a large part of our game and it will provide variety for multiple playthroughs.
The enemies use AI to realistically navigate around the scene (either towards player or presents), and the AI is from a Unity Package for “AI Navigation
2. Mobile Sensors - We selected this because we felt it is a very natural input method that will increase how immersive our game is.
The android phone’s gyroscope will be used to track head movement for 3 features: nodding down to cycle through guns and grabbed furniture follows the head movement


Interaction Techniques 
------------------------------------------------------------
We are using raycast and mobile sensors.
The android phone will be used to move raycast to point at an object while the controller will handle inputs for different object interactions.
